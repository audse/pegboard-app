# pegboard - a flexible project management app
The core principle of Pegboard is to organize the way you would in real life- an endlessly customizable dumping ground for all your great ideas.

## Technologies

### Backend
* Python with Django and Django REST Framework
* PostgreSQL

### Frontend
* Vue3
* Quasar
* My Custom UI Library (Cosmic Component Library) for Vue3 - [find out more here](https://github.com/audse/cosmic-library)

## Features
* Organize your ideas into cards, lists, and boards for ultimate flexibility.
* Automatically generate color themes (or pick from out presets) to give each board a different vibe (and pick a sitewide theme to your taste).

### Roadmap
Pegboard is currently still under development. In the future, there are plans to implement the following features:
- [ ] Drag and drop pretty much anything, anywhere.
- [ ] Calendar view - all due dates (and to-do dates) at a glance.
- [ ] Image board view - collect your photos and inspiration in a Pinterest-style layout.
- [ ] Work within a team or a family.
- [ ] Search all cards with a menagerie of filters.
- [ ] Choose what information is most prominent per board, per list, or even on a card-by-card basis.

## Installation
Pegboard is still under development, so installation is not recommended.
